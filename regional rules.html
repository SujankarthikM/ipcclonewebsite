        <h2>Regional Rules</h2>
	<h1 style="text-align:center">ICPC Regional Rules for Regionals 2023/24</h1>
	<h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>If a team wishes to be able to qualify for the ICPC World Finals, then before competing in ANY regional qualifying contest, the coach and all team members must be fully registered in the ICPC Registration System.  A qualifying contest is one that allows teams to be promoted to a higher level and which is supervised by faculty.  An online contest which is unsupervised may not be classified as a qualifying contest.  Registration may not be done retrospectively.  Incomplete registration or circumvention that leads to incomplete or false data is grounds for immediate disqualification.</p>
	<h2><br>Mission</h2>
	<p>The ICPC, the “International Collegiate Programming Contest”, is an extra-curricular, competitive programming sport for the universities of the world.  ICPC competitions provide gifted students with opportunities to interact, demonstrate, and improve their teamwork, programming, and problem-solving prowess. The ICPC is a global platform for academia, industry, and community to shine the spotlight on and raise the aspirations of the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence.</p>
	<h2><br>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The contest is a multi-tiered team competition for students enrolled in degree granting institutions of higher education. The tiers range from local contests conducted by universities to the highest-level Regional Contest, conducted or hosted by universities from which teams advance to the ICPC World Finals.  Teams have the right to advance only for qualifying contests.  The hierarchy of qualifying regional contests is shown in the ICPC Registration System.  At any level, teams may be invited to advance to the next level using wildcards in harmony with the ICPC Goals, to serve the most students, from the most universities, from the most geographical locations, with equitable access to the World Finals.
<br>
Historically, the ICPC World Finals is hosted by one or more universities that conduct the event between April and June.  However, due to the pandemic and establishing Region Championships, the ICPC World Finals 2024 is targeted for the first half of the last quarter of 2024.  The date of the ICPC World Finals will be published no later than three months before the date of the ICPC World Finals and no earlier than the ICPC World Finals 2023.  Future World Finals will likely be scheduled earlier in the year, but by no more than 2 months earlier per year.</p>
	<h2><br>Team Composition</h2>
	<p>All team members must be enrolled in the same degree-granting institution of higher education, herein called the “team institution.”  A contact at the team institution, typically a faculty member, must be designated and registered as the “team coach”. The team coach must certify the eligibility of contestants and be the official point-of-contact with the team before and during contest activities.  A team may only have one registered coach, and that coach cannot also be a contestant.

The team coach must fully register teams in the ICPC Registration System within the time set by the regional rules which, for all qualifying Regional Contests, is no later than 7 days before the contest.  A team is not eligible to compete in the regional contest until the regional contest director has accepted the team in the web registration system.  Teams failing to comply with any of these requirements will be ruled ineligible to compete.  Only registered reserves may be substituted for contestants.  Such substitutions must be entered in the ICPC Registration System by the regional contest director before the contest begins.  A reserve can only be substituted for a contestant before the first qualifying contest. Each team consists of three contestants who are eligible to compete in the ICPC World Finals as described under Advancing to the ICPC World Finals in the Regional Rules.  The team's contestants must satisfy all eligibility requirements. For more complex decisions, the Eligibility Decision Tree can be used. </p>

	<h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
	<p>An eligible student must be willing and able to compete in the ICPC World Finals.  In particular, a student who requires a visa to study at the team’s institution must be able to gain a visa to travel to the ICPC World Finals plus be able to return to the team institution's location after the Finals.  A student must be enrolled in a degree program at the team institution with at least a half-time load.  This rule is not to be construed as disqualifying co-op students, exchange students, students serving internships, or extramural students.  
<br>
Limits on Participation:  Disruption in enrollment caused by epidemics is normally waived.
<ol type="1">
<li>A student may compete only on teams with the same team institution during a contest year. </li>
<li>A student who has competed in two ICPC World Finals is NOT eligible to compete in ICPC Regionals with the following exceptions:  <br>
<ol type="a">
<li>ICPC World Finals Moscow (Oct 2021) participation is NOT counted towards the max participation in two ICPC World Finals.  This exception will be removed for regional year 2025/26; and </li>
<li>A student promoted to compete in ICPC World Finals 2023 for either of the World Championships conducted in Sharm during November 2023 will be counted as having participated in one World Finals towards the max participation in two World Finals.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A student who has competed in qualifying regional contests during five different contest years is NOT eligible to compete with the following exceptions: <br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Regional participation in 2020/21 is not counted towards the maximum of 5 different contest years.  This exception will be removed for regional year 2025/26; and </li>
<li>Regional participation in ICPC Regionals 2021/22 and ICPC Regionals 2022/23 counts as only one year of regional competition. This exception will be removed from the regional year 2025/26..</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
	<h2>Period of Eligibility</h2>
	<p>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and FIRST began post-secondary studies in 2019 or later is eligible to compete. A student who meets the Basic Requirements and was born in 2000 or later is eligible to compete.  The eligibility status for the regional year 2023/24 is determined as of the date of the first qualifying contest or 1 October 2023, whichever best favors student eligibility.
<br><br>

Extending the Period of Eligibility
<br><br>
A coach may petition the ICPC Eligibility Committee at least three weeks before the regional contest, to extend the Period of Eligibility for a student whose full-time studies have been interrupted or extended.  (This includes military or civilian service, illness, epidemics, any work, other studies, or personal reasons).  The coach must demonstrate that such an extension would not provide an unfair advantage to the team.  
<br><br>
A petition will normally be approved if the student meets the Basic Eligibility Requirements and has not completed more than the equivalent of eight semesters of full-time STEM study as of the date of the first qualifying contest or 1 October 2023, whichever best favors student eligibility.  The ICPC Eligibility Committee will render a decision within five days of receiving the petition.
