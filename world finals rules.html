        <h2>World Finals Rules</h2>
	<h1 style="text-align:center">2023 ICPC World Finals Rules - Sharm el-Sheikh </h1>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) provides college students with opportunities to interact with students from other universities and to sharpen and demonstrate their problem-solving, programming, and teamwork skills.  The contest provides a platform for industry and academia to encourage and focus public attention on the next generation of computing professionals as they pursue excellence. (from the ICPC Policies and Procedures)</p>
	<h2><br>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The contest is a two-tiered competition among teams of students representing institutions of higher education. Teams first compete in Regional Contests held around the world from September to December each year. Based on their performance in Regional Contests, top-ranking teams advance to the International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals. Additional high-ranking teams may be invited to the World Finals.  At most 140 teams will be invited to compete onsite.  These rules are subject to change.</p>
	<h2><br>Organisation</h2>
	<p>The ICPC is organized according to the ICPC Policies and Procedures in harmony with the ICPC Code of Ethics and Overview.  The Executive Committee, chaired by the Executive Director, sets the policy and general rules for the conduct of the contest. The Executive Director is solely responsible for interpreting the rules and for ruling on unforeseen situations.</p>
	<h2><br>Team Requirements</h2>
	<p>Teams qualify to advance to the World Finals through Regional Contests. See the ICPC Regional Rules and Region-Specific Rules for details on advancing to the World Finals.  Only one team from a given institution may advance to the World Finals. No team member on the qualifying team may have competed as a contestant in two previous World Finals.
<br>
The coach of a qualifying team is the point of contact before and during World Finals activities. A contestant of a team may not serve as the coach.  The coach must complete certification at the Team Certification Web Site within five (5) business days of notification.  Qualifying teams will be invited by email and postal mail (if requested) soon after completing certification.
<br>
All team members attending the teamâ€™s institution on visas must be permitted to return to their point of origin after the World Finals.  Qualifying teams requiring visas must initiate the process of applying for visas within 10 business days of being invited to apply for a visa. Teams failing to comply with any of these requirements will be ruled ineligible to compete in the World Finals.  Upon completion of these requirements, a qualifying team will be advanced to the World Finals.
<br>
A team advancing to the World Finals will comprise the same three members as when it qualified. (Reserves are not allowed at the Finals.)  If a team member is unwilling, unable, or unfit to compete in the World Finals, the coach must notify the ICPC Contest Manager in a timely manner. A team member who is unwilling or unfit to compete in the World Finals will be disqualified from further ICPC competitions.  The team member may appeal disqualification to the Appeals Committee.
<br>
At on-site registration, participants must provide a picture ID (passport, driver's license, etc).  Contestants must show proof of enrollment at the university during the term of the regional contest at which they qualified.  A letter on university stationery with the signature of a university official accompanied by an English translation is sufficient.
<br>
Due to COVID, exceptions to these rules take precedence. See the ICPC Regional Rules for exceptions.  All team members are responsible to follow all health safety rules.</p>

	<h2>Attendance</h2>
	<p>Finalists must attend all required events from On-Site Registration to Celebration as indicated in the Schedule of Events.  Failure to attend any required event could result in disqualification and forfeiture of scholarships and prizes.  Coaches must be accessible during On-Site Registration, Dress Rehearsal, the World Finals Championship, and the Closing Ceremony.
</p>
	<h2>Scoring of the Finals</h2>
	<p>The World Finals Judges are solely responsible for determining the correctness of submitted runs. In consultation with the World Finals Judges, the Director of Judging is responsible for determining the winners of the World Finals. They are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions. Their decisions are final.
<br>
Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. Teams placing in the first twelve places who solve the same number of problems are ranked first by the least total time and, if need be, by the earliest time of submission of the last accepted run.
<br>
The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem (except that there is no penalty for runs rejected due to Compilation Error). There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.
